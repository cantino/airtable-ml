# Airtable ML

#### An open source, neural network-based Airtable Block for performing automatic prediction & classification.

* Automates record prioritization, sales predictions, user assignment, classification, numerical regression, and much more. 
* Given a set of Airtable fields, predict: numbers, categories, dates, currency values, and more.
* Learns from correct examples to predict new examples.
* Free and open source.

## Contributing

We'd love your open source contributions, especially in the following areas:

* Cleanup UI so it uses a stepper instead of settings.
* Cross Validation
* Visualize error rate.
* Allow stopping.
* Allow configuration of values in an advanced mode.
* Allow application to a different table.
* Ensure all fields still exist in the table.
* Ensure (early) that prediction and output fields are of the same type.
* Ensure prediction and target column are different.
* Ensure all columns still exist.
* Only predict for empty values.
