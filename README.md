#### An open source, neural network-based Airtable Block for performing automatic prediction & classification.

* Automates record prioritization, sales predictions, user assignment, classification, numerical regression, and much more. 
* Given a set of Airtable fields, predict: numbers, categories, dates, currency values, and more.
* Learns from correct examples to predict new examples.
* Free and open source.

## Contributing

We'd love your open source contributions, especially in the following areas:

* Visualize error rate.
* Cross Validation to provide a more accurate estimate of error.
* Allow stopping of training.
* Allow application to a different table by storing Field names instead of Ids.
* Allow training of other types of models (interspectible decision trees, for example), and LSTM models for text generation.
